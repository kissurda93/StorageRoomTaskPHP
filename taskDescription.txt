Example Task for developer applicant, junior/medior level
--------------------------------------------------

Use PHP (or optionally Typescript*), OOP.
Do not include external source code, no database, or file i/o needed.


Task short description:
     We have a storage room, with multiple containers of different types:
        refrigerator, box

     We have food ingredients:
        meat, salad, rice, flour, fish

     Task is to store ingredients in the storage room / containers.


Implement classes:
	* class StorageRoom using StorageRoomInterface
	* abstract class Container  using ContainerInterface
	* classes Box, Refrigerator inherited from Container
	* feel free to add classes if needed
	Hint:	See Interfaces/ folder


There are some rules, hints:
	You can have multiple containers of the same type ( 2 refrigerator, 3 boxes)

	Containers have limited space of storage:
		refrigerator: 100 space-unit,
		box: 40 space-unit

	Different types of ingredients occupy different amount of space-units from containers:
		meat:12 space-unit,
		salad:30 space-unit,
		rice:8 space-unit,
		flour:15 space-unit,
		fish:15 space-unit

	We can store some ingredients:
		fish, meat: only in fridge
		salad: in fridge and/or box
		rice, flour: only in boxes

	In a box container, ingredients cannot be mixed

	When adding ingredients to storage room:
	 	Use containers in order (start using a new container only if no space in previous)
	 	(maybe portion of ingredient must be split)

	Nice-t-have-feature:
		If an ingredient can be stored in a box and fridge, we should try to use a box if possible.


Testing:
	For testing run index.php.
	You can modify index.php,Inventory.php, StorageRoomTest.php if needed,
	but should work with the original ones.
	For output example see: resultExample.txt


*TypeScript:
	In case using typesript recreate given classes in a similar structure if possible.
